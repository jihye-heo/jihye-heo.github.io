## Working Papers
### * Product Bundling, Joint Markups and Trade liberalization (*Job Market Paper*) [Draft avaiable upon request]
---
**Abstract**: Product bundling is a frequent practice by multi-product firms to increase their profit. This paper examines how product bundling affects a firm's markups at various levels in international trade. Joint pricing decisions for multi-product firms with product bundling entail information about joint markups in their profit maximization problem. Utilizing this information, I propose a method to estimate joint markups for multi-product firms with product bundling at the transaction level. Focusing on Chinese exporter firms, the Chinese Customs data show that multi-product firms with product bundling enjoy higher markups than separate pricing firms on average. Exploiting China's WTO accession as a trade liberalization event, further analysis shows that multi-product firms with product bundling also benefit the most due to improved market access by the trade liberalization and have the lowest pass-through rate of costs to prices. <br>
