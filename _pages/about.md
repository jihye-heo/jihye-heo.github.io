Hello, I am Ji Hye Heo, a Ph.D. candidate in Economics at Vanderbilt University. My areas of interest are industrial organization, international trade, and applied econometrics. I am particularly interested in product bundling practices by multi-product firms. In particular, my job market paper studies how firms utilize product bundling to increase markups, and
trade liberalization reduces markup dispersion across firms.

I am currently on the 2022-2023 Job Market and available for interviews at the ASSA 2023 Virtual Annual meeting.

**Fields of Specialization**: Industrial Organization, International Trade, Applied Econometrics
