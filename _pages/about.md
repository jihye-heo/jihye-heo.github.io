Hello, I am a Ph.D. candidate in Economics at Vanderbilt University.
I am currently on the 2022-2023 Job Market and available for interviews at the ASSA 2023 Virtual Annual meeting.

My job market paper studies how firms may utilize product bundling to increase markups and market power during a trade liberalization.

Here is a link to my [CV](/cv_jihye.pdf) and my [job market paper](/Heo_2022_.pdf).

**Fields of Specialization**: Industrial Organization, International Trade, Applied Econometrics
